  Single Linux server with [IPython
  Notebook 2.0](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) installed.
instructions: |
  #### IPython notebook

  This launches an [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) server
  fully configured with scientific packages and inline matplotlib/pylab.

  When the deployment finishes, you can access your deployment by using the IP
  provided above. Login using the password you specified during deployment.
  *The certificate will give an error as it is self-signed.*

  #### Packages installed

  By default, the python packages installed include

  * cython
  * matplotlib
  * networkx
  * nltk
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * patsy
  * pillow
  * pytables
  * scikit-image
  * scikit-learn
  * scipy
  * statsmodels
  * sympy
  * theano
  * xlrd
  * xlwt

  #### Easy mode installation of more packages

  If you want more packages installed, simply pip install them from within the
  IPython notebook:

  ```python
  In[1]: !pip install pkg_name
  ```

  This will install it within the virtualenv that IPython notebook runs in.

  #### Hard mode installation

  Alternatively, you can ssh to the box, change user to ipynb, source the
  virtualenv (`source ~ipynb/.ipyvirt/bin/activate`) and do a pip install.

  ```bash
  (.ipyvirt)$ pip install pkg_name
  ```

  If other system dependencies are needed, you will need to SSH to the box and
  install the system packages (or ask us for help).

  #### Logging in via SSH

  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
